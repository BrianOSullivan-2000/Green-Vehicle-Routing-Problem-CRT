# Green-Vehicle-Routing-Problem-CRT

Group project for SFI CRT in Foundations of Data Science, Autumn 2021. 

We wish to create and characterise appropriate benchmark instances for solving the Green Vehicle Routing Problem, a problem which seeks to minimise carbon emissions in vehicle networks.
These instances will follow similar lines to traditional instances for CVRPs, but will instead cater towards an emissions model. Such instances will need to account for parameters such as gradient, vehicle load, traffic, and weather.

Supervised under Paula Carroll, Conor Sweeney and Mel Devine at University College Dublin.
