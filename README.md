# Green-Vehicle-Routing-Problem-CRT
Group project for Science Foundation Ireland Centre for Research Training in Foundations of Data Science. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
We wish to create and characterise appropriate benchmark instances for solving the Green Vehicle Routing Problem, a problem which seeks to minimise carbon emissions in vehicle networks.
These instances will follow similar lines to traditional instances for CVRPs, but will instead cater towards an emissions model. Thus, these instances will need to account for parameters such as gradient, load, traffic, weather.

Supervised under Paula Carroll, Conor Sweeney and Mel Devine at University College Dublin.
